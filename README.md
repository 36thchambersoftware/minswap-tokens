# ðŸ˜½ Minswap tokens

## Overview

The merge of deprecated verified-tokens and market cap repositories, which contains a list of tokens, exposes APIs for transparent access to circulating supply and total supply.

As of latest update, we consider `circulating = maxSupply - treasury - burn` and `total = maxSupply - burn` as standard formulas for calculating marketcap information.

In cases where `circulatingOnChain` is provided directly according to the asset's quantity on-chain or through external APIs, the `circulating` is the value of `circulatingOnChain`.

For tokens providing with `treasuryNft`, the `circulating` is the quantity of the address containing the assets. In default, the amount is retrieved from the oldest address from the blockchain's point of view.

## How to add my token
### Requirements
As token verification prerequisites, ensure your token has:
- A pool with at least **1000 ADA TVL**
- A logo added in the [Cardano Token Registry](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry) or CIP-68 metadata
and follow the structure stated in the instructions below.
- A post of your policy ID on Twitter or your policy ID displayed on your landing page.

For tokens to be verified:
1. Create a transaction transfer **100 ADA** to Minswap wallet receiving token verification fee below. This fee appears as the cost for lifetime maintain this repository.
2. Metadata includes: **the last 4 numbers of asset's policyId and asset's ticker** (for example, Verify 70c6 MIN).
3. Attach the transaction hash to a comment in the yaml file pull request (instructions below).

Any token that has been verified does not meet the requirements in the future would still be unverified.

### Create pull request

1. Create a pull request adding yaml file according to the following structure in the `src/tokens`:

```yaml
# 1 token = 1 yaml file
# filename/assetId: policyId + hex-coded token name

project: Minswap
# among DeFi, RealFi, GameFi, Meme, Bridge, Metaverse, Wallet, NFT, Oracle, AI, Launchpad, DAO, Stablecoin, Social, Media, Risk Ratings, Index Vaults, DePIN, Other
categories:
  - DeFi
  - DAO

decimals: 0
# not required, among website, twitter, discord, telegram, coinMarketCap, coinGecko
socialLinks:
  website: https://
  discord: ...

verified: true # default true, if a token violate verification policy then switch to false

# the following fields are not required
maxSupply: 500000000 # either number or string
# or
maxSupply: https://...

treasury:

## Usage

```ts
import {
  BlockFrostAdapter,
  MarketCapAPI,
  TokenAPI,
} from "@minswap/minswap-tokens";

const MIN_TOKEN =
  "29d222ce763455e3d7a09a665ce554f00ac89d2e99a1a83d267170c64d494e";

// getting token info
const tokenApi = new TokenAPI();

const minTokenInfo = await tokenApi.getToken(MIN_TOKEN);

console.log(minTokenInfo);

// getting Market Cap info
const blockFrostAdapter = new BlockFrostAdapter({
  projectId: "<your_project_id_here>",
  requestTimeout: 20_000,
});

const marketCapApi = new MarketCapAPI(blockFrostAdapter);

const minMarketCapInfo = await marketCapApi.getMarketCapInfo(minTokenInfo);
console.log(minMarketCapInfo);
// { circulating: '240813714.66121483', total: '5000000000' }
```
